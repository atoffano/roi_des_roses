# roi_des_roses

A small game made during my python course in my first year of master.
This is basically the very first mentionnable project i've completed.

The game Roi des Roses features two players placing in turn a piece on a board around their main piece, the king.
Each players tries to maximize the number of adjacent pawns, forming a 'territory'. The player with the most territory at the end of the game wins.
The exact location depend on which cards the player has in hand. Each card represents a position on the board relative to the player's king.
Multiple actions are available to the players, such as moving their king, placing a piece or drawing a card.
